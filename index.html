    <p style="font-size:20px;font-family:'Comic sans MS'"> Waluigi is the best character and should be added to smash ultimate and any other future smash games. Conversely, he is so powerful that he has no special moves, as he doesn't need them. It is known that he is more powerful than thanos and thanoscopter at max power level</p>
